# Visualizing-the-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners

##  Project Description
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of Nobel Prize winners using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) in Google Colab.

The main goals were:
- To explore trends in gender, nationality, and award categories
- To identify which countries and fields have received the most awards
- To visualize insights

This beginner-friendly analysis helped me practice data cleaning, grouping, and plotting.
